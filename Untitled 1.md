Here's a combined structural mark scheme that integrates both the original mark scheme and the sustainability assessment study requirements:

# Sustainability Assessment Mark Scheme

| Section | Criteria | Sub-Criteria | Marks |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| **1. Introduction (5%)** | Product Selection & Justification | - Clear explanation of chosen product and comparator<br>- Justification for selection (global/personal importance) | 2% |
| | Aims & Objectives | - Clearly stated aims and objectives of the study | 3% |
| **2. Environmental Assessment (30%)** | Methodology | - Appropriate environmental indicator(s) selected<br>- Proper LCA framework followed (goal/scope, inventory, impact, interpretation) | 5% |
| | Data Collection | - Comprehensive inventory data across life cycle stages<br>- Well-referenced sources<br>- Clear documentation of assumptions | 10% |
| | Impact Assessment | - Accurate calculation of total emissions<br>- Proper use of equivalence factors (e.g., COâ‚‚e for GWP) | 5% |
| | Interpretation | - Identification of emission hotspots<br>- Comparison with comparator product<br>- Sensitivity analysis of key assumptions | 10% |
| **3. Economic Assessment (20%)** | Methodology | - Appropriate economic indicator(s) selected | 3% |
| | Data Collection | - Comprehensive cost data collection<br>- Clear documentation of assumptions/methods | 7% |
| | Analysis | - Accurate total cost calculation<br>- Identification of cost hotspots<br>- Consideration of NPV/discounting where relevant | 10% |
| **4. Social Assessment (10%)** | Methodology | - Appropriate social indicator(s) selected | 2% |
| | Analysis | - Effective discussion/quantification of social impacts<br>- Comparison with comparator product | 8% |
| **5. Interpretation & Design Integration (20%)** | Comparative Analysis | - Balanced comparison across all sustainability indicators<br>- Consideration of weighting/prioritization | 8% |
| | Improvement Strategies | - Specific recommendations for design changes<br>- Material/process/energy alternatives proposed<br>- Feasibility discussion | 12% |
| **6. Conclusions (5%)** | Summary | - Concise summary of key findings<br>- Clear conclusions drawn from analysis | 2% |
| | Recommendations | - Practical improvement recommendations<br>- Policy/implementation considerations<br>- Future work suggestions | 3% |
| **7. Report Quality (10%)** | Structure | - Logical flow and organization<br>- Appropriate sectioning | 2% |
| | Presentation | - Effective use of visuals (graphs, tables, diagrams)<br>- Professional formatting | 3% |
| | Academic Standards | - Proper referencing throughout<br>- Adherence to word limit<br>- Clear, concise writing | 5% |

**Key Requirements:**
- Minimum 4 sustainability indicators (1+ from each category: environmental, economic, social)
- Fair comparison with equivalent comparator product
- Sensitivity analysis of key assumptions
- Multi-criteria consideration of sustainability trade-offs
- Practical design improvement recommendations

**Assessment Focus:**
- Rigor of methodology
- Quality and transparency of data
- Depth of analysis and interpretation
- Practical relevance of recommendations
- Overall clarity and professionalism of report

This combined structure maintains all assessment elements while providing clearer guidance on expectations and weighting for each component. The mark allocation aligns with the original scheme while incorporating the detailed requirements from the study brief.
