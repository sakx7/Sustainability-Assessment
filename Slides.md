# Natural disasters

- Each year more than 100 countries experience the effects of natural disasters
- Over 200 million people impacted by natural disasters annually. 
- On average 20–40 million people require temporary shelters

## Data sources

- On site energy generation with use of Perovskite flexible solar cells at lower cost and higher power conversion efficiency compared to traditional solar panel (1m² single junction perovskite power cell has 26.7% of efficiency)
- Use of available reperches of 7 bed army tents performance and manufacturer specifications, type and quality of material
- Carbon footprint analysis during production and disposal based on available for army tents made of synthetic material
- Major and minor assumption such as transportation of product or sources of material
