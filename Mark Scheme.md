| **Introduction / Motivation and Aims and Objectives**       | - Selection of product and comparator product<br>- Justification for selection, why it is important to the world/to you<br>- Specifically outline the aims and objectives of the work                                                                                                                                                                     |  5%  |
| **Environmental Assessment**                                | - Selection of environmental indicator<br>- Following LCA method (goal and scope, inventory, impact assessment, interpretation)<br>- Data collection (well referenced, data quality, robust assumptions made) for the inventory<br>- Estimating total emissions (impact assessment)<br>- Identify largest emissions and key sources (hotspot analysis)    | 30%  |
| **Economic Assessment**                                     | - Selection of appropriate economic indicator(s)<br>- Data collection, indicate how you have estimated the cost, any assumptions you have made<br>- Estimate total cost and the hotspots of the cost (where are the largest contributors to cost)                                                                                                         | 20%  |
| **Social Assessment**                                       | - Selection of appropriate social indicator(s)<br>- Depending on the indicator, discuss OR quantify the impact of the product on the social indicator                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 10%  |
| **Interpretation / Discussion / Incorporation into Design** | - Compare results across sustainability indicators<br>- Discuss benefits or otherwise associated with product<br>- How could impacts be improved?<br>- Suggest at least 1 recommendation for change in design, change in feedstock/materials/energy/processes.                                                                                            | 20%  |
| **Conclusions**                                             | - Suggest how could the improvement be made?<br>- Could manufacturers implement changes or is there a cost trade-off?<br>- Would regional policy/regulation need to change to enable improvements?<br>- Summary of the study<br>- Key findings<br>- Key recommendations for improvement to product<br>- Recommendations for further work to improve study |  5%  |
| **Report Quality**                                          | - Structure<br>- Written quality<br>- Use of visuals (graphs, diagrams, supporting information)<br>- Referencing<br>- Within word limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 10%  |
