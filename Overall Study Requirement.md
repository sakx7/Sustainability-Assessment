# Sustainability Assessment Study Requirements

## Aim
To conduct a sustainability assessment for a product of your choosing.

## 1. Choose a product to assess
- This can be any product or process of your choice!
- You will need to explain:
  - Why you chose it
  - Why it's important to study its sustainability
  - Why it's important to you

## 2. Choose a comparator product
- Either conduct an assessment of this comparable product or collect existing data
- Should provide a similar purpose/function
- Ensure fair comparison by:
  - Defining similar study scope
  - Accounting for different life spans
  - Comparing equivalent products

## 3. Select 4 sustainability indicators
- Must include at least 1 from each category:
  - Environmental
  - Economic
  - Social

## 4. Conduct sustainability assessment

### a. Environmental assessment (LCA methodology)
- Use Life Cycle Assessment approach
- Include ≥1 environmental indicator (preferably more)
  - e.g., climate change, human toxicity, water footprint, acidification potential

### b. Define goal and scope
- **Goal**
- **Scope**:
  - Boundary
  - Cut-off points
  - Cradle-to-grave or gated process

### c. Collect inventory data
- Across each life cycle stage:
  - Environmental inputs/outputs
  - Mass and energy requirements
  - Pollution and waste data
- Document assumptions where data is unavailable
- Note assumptions for sensitivity analysis

### d. Impact assessment
- Combine emissions to estimate total contribution to environmental indicator
  - e.g., climate change using CO₂ equivalents (GWP)
- Quantify total emissions per stage

### e. Interpretation
- Identify emission 'hotspots'
- Determine largest emissions and key sources
- Compare with comparator product
- Evaluate potential for product/technology switch
- Suggest impact reduction strategies:
  - Material changes
  - Process improvements
  - Energy source alternatives
  - Design modifications

### f. Economic assessment
- Collect data similar to environmental assessment
- Document necessary assumptions
- Estimate total economic cost
- Identify major cost contributors
- Consider appropriate methodologies:
  - Net-present value
  - Discounting
  - Financing decisions

## 5. Sensitivity analysis
- Identify key data sources affecting results
- Assess data quality/assumptions
- Conduct sensitivity analysis:
  - Test impact of altered assumptions
  - Evaluate effect on technology preference

## 6. Incorporation into design
- Compare all 4 sustainability indicators
- Discuss preference for your technology vs comparator:
  - What's better/worse?
  - Should indicators be weighted differently?
  - Consider multi-criteria decision analysis
- Make improvement recommendations
- Discuss potential impact of improvements

## 7. Conclusions
- Summarize findings
- Present key conclusions
- Identify needs for further work
- Provide product improvement recommendations:
  - Design changes
  - Material alternatives
- Discuss implementation:
  - Need for policy/regulation changes?
  - Cost-effectiveness of improvements?
